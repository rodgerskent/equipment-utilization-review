## Utilization Behavior & Trends of the CitiBike fleet in New Jersey
Utilized Tableau to complete a business review of the Jersey City ‘citibike’ program from 2018 to 2020. Key analyst actions included:
* []()Consolidated 36 monthly csv files into one dataset using the union function
* []()Built and analyzed a number of business elements landing on 10 key insights
* []()Built a four-page business review presentation using four (4) “Dashboards”
* []()Built a “Story” stepping through ten (10) key insights 
* []()Built two interactive maps showing bike station usage by year or via a time ‘slider’
* []()Deployed both the Tableau “Story” and “Dashboards” via Tableau Public

## Key Insights
The following key insights were brought to life in the assessment.
* []()The ‘citibike’ service line is on a strong growth trajectory - Overall trip hours logged on the bike fleet are up 80.4% in 2020 versus 2019. This large volume increase is occurring despite that fact that trip volume is down 16.8% from 2019. Average trip duration is up substantially suggesting that the loss in commuter usage is being replaced by more leisure riders. 
* []()The customer mix is changing. Female ridership is up for the second year in a row and up a full 7.1 percentage points from 2018. Monthly “subscriber” volume has declined for the second straight year and is being replaced by “customers” (per trip or per day riders). ‘Customer’ mix is up 20.6 percentage points from last year. The accelerated work-from-home and stay-at-home trends explain this phenomenon. 
* []()The ‘citibike’ program has a significant commuter client base. Weekday bike usage patterns show that many trips end at the New Jersey PATH stations (rail stations) in the morning and originate again from the PATH stations in the evening. This is a clear sign that riders are using the bikes to move between home and the rail stations as part of their commute.
